Core concepts:

- Events - Each record in a stream of data is an *event* occurring at a specific point in time
- Objects - What the data in an event record represents
- Properties - Fields in the event data can be mapped to properties of the business object
- Rules - The key to using Activator by defining conditions under which an action is triggered
