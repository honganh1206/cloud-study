[[Semantic models]]

We can switch between the Data (tables in the semantic folder), Query (SQL queries used to create the semantic model) and Model (just the semantic model) view

We use **Relationships** to connect tables in the semantic model

**Measures** are the metrics we want to analyze in our data warehouse. They are calculated fields based on the data in the tables using the DAX formula language
